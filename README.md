## Describtion
The provided repository serves as a demonstration of the application of deep learning techniques in the prediction of the spectral response of all-optical plasmonic switches. This repository is based on the extensive research presented in the paper titled "Enabling_inverse_design_of_chirped_apodized_fiber_Bragg_grating_with_deep_learning." It has been designed to address inverse design challenges, with a specific focus on the fields of photonics and optics.
